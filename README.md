# Vehicle-Tracking-system
The concept behind our project is to create an innovative vehicle speed detection system that utilizes video streaming technology. This system focuses on capturing video footage that includes moving vehicles, along with designated starting and ending points. The primary goal is to effectively detect and track these vehicles, allowing us to accurately calculate their speed.

The Speed Detection System (SDS) serves as a modern alternative to traditional methods like radar. By employing advanced image processing techniques on the video stream collected from cameras, SDS overcomes many of the challenges associated with conventional radar systems. This means that our system can accurately measure the speed of moving vehicles while minimizing the issues often faced with older technologies.
